RIGCTL v1.07.08  9 AUG 2015

If you do not have the rigctl utility installed, then on a Debian-esque system:

	sudo apt-get install libhamlib-utils

You may also be asked to install libhamlib if it is not yet installed.

CONFIG:  For rigctl to work, you will need to find your radio number from the 
list provided by:

	rigctl -l | more

You will also need to know yhe serial interface that is used to do rig control 
(CAT, CI-V, etc).  It may be /dev/ttyS0 or /dev/ttyUSB1 or something similar.  

In my case for example:

	rigctlnum=127
	rigctlport=/dev/ttyUSB2

Edit the file /etc/uichatd/uichatd.rigctl and insert those values and save the file.  
Restart UIChat and then use the "rig" command in UIChat.  Essentially the "rig" 
command simply creates the command line for rigctl for you up to the point of 
you giving commands to the rig.

Examples:

Query the current frequency:
UICHAT> rig f
14101600

Set the new frequency:
UICHAT> rig F 14105000

Turn on PTT:
UICHAT> rig T 1

Turn off PTT:
UICHAT> rig T 0

See the "man rigctl" page for full details.

SO FAR I have only tested this on my own rig, so I am anxious to hear feedback 
from others about whether the minimal configuration is sufficient on other rigs, 
particularly ICOM since there may need to be a CI-V parameter required.  With 
your help, I can enhance these configuration parameters.

ONE LAST THING:

The main discussion will be found at Sourceforge.net.  Eventually, the tarballs 
will also be moved to Sourceforge.
